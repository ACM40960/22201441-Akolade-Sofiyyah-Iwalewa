## AI IMAGE CLASSIFICATION: ROAD TRANSPORTATION IMAGES
### Project Overview
This project focus is on Convolutional Network Networks (CNNs) for the multiclass classification encompassing six distinct vehicle categories: Ambulance, Bicycle, Bus, Car, Motorcycle and Taxi. The core aim of the poject is the creation of sophistiscated algrothms capable of autonomously discerning and categorizing images into these predefined classes,
like human do. The primary goal is to develop an accurate and efficient image classification system that can distinguish between these diverse classes of vehicles.

### Dataset
The dataset employed here is an extract from the 'TAU Vehicle Type Recognition Competition' dataset. Originally comprising 8 vehicle classes within its training folder, I meticulously narrowed it down to 6 distinct classes, thereby assembling a dataset housing a collective sum of 3394 images. This subset was derived from Kaggle's primary training repository, from which I further curated 1127 images and designated them to a dedicated validation folder. Meanwhile, the 'test2' directory encompasses a variable count of images, spanning between 15 to 50 samples, which serves as the canvas for predictive tasks. As an auxiliary component, the 'test' folder features a compilation of 20 randomly selected images, forming a loop through which predictions are generated and subsequently showcased alongside their anticipated classifications.
