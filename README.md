## AI IMAGE CLASSIFICATION: ROAD TRANSPORTATION IMAGES
### Project Overview
This project focus is on Convolutional Network Networks (CNNs) for the multiclass classification encompassing six distinct vehicle categories: Ambulance, Bicycle, Bus, Car, Motorcycle and Taxi. The core aim of the poject is the creation of sophistiscated algrothms capable of autonomously discerning and categorizing images into these predefined classes,
like human do. The primary goal is to develop an accurate and efficient image classification system that can distinguish between these diverse classes of vehicles.
